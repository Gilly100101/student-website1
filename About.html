<b>(<span class="multicolortext">Gilly</span>)</b> (co-founder) - Have been making ice cream and other types of ice creams for over 2 years. I love what I do, and it's all because of my passion for people and the way they interact with one another. I want to make sure that everyone has a place where they can feel at home, whether they're here in my shop or at home with the family. Whether you're looking for an ice cream cake, popsicle sticks, or just something new to try!
